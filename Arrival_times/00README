Estimate P and S arrival times from hypocenter to station locations through ray theory

How to use the folders inside:

Compilation of code
1. go to /src/
2. make clean
3. make
This will create a binary inside /bin/arrtime

Run the binary
1. go to /run/
cd run
2. make executable script for runtime
chmod +x execute.sh
3. copy stations-utm.dat from /Stations/ to Arrival_times/run/
cp ../../Stations/stations-utm.dat .
4. run the code
./execute.sh
5. prepare arrival_times.out this is the same as output.dat but without sation names
6. run sum_arr.m to add the origin time
octave sum_arr.m

input:
arrtime.in          -> file with input parameters
stations-utm.dat    -> file with station xy locations
           DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES OF INPUT FILES

output:
output.dat          -> file with P and S arrival times
arrival_times.out   -> same as output.dat but without names
final_arrival_times.out   -> arrival times + origin time

The code takes a while to finish. Be patient!

Change run/arrtime.in according to your velocity model, number of stations and hypocenter depth

try not to change the next parameters:
0.2                     ! h (regular velocity model grid increment, km)
10.0                    ! Stations' distance from hypocenters' grid boundaries

Usual output screen without errors:

../bin/arrtime < arrtime.in
