1. go to /obs/
cd obs/

2. run the cut_data.m this cuts the data according to the P arrival times
   you need to modify it according to your stations and arrival times
   from Arrival_times/run/final_arrival_times.out remember to add the origin time!
octave cut_data.m

3. go back 
cd ../

4. make executable script
chmod +x prepare.sh

###header1.txt
N=time samples at files
Delta=time sampling rate
ini=0 always

5. prepare files to add zeros between origin time and P arrival time
./prepare.sh

6. run the code that adds zeros and filters the data
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < seismograms.m

The output will be three files 
obs_velo_ew
obs_velo_ns
obs_velo_zz
all seismograms are concatanated

7. cut the data from the concatanated files and puts them in separated files
octave cut_out.m

THE FILES INSIDE /obs/ MUST BE CUT AT THE ARRIVAL OF P
